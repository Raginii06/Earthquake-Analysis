# Earthquake-Prediction-of-Japan
This repository contains an earthquake prediction model using time series analysis techniques like SMA, EMA, and ARIMA. Leveraging USGS seismic data for Japan, the model predicts earthquake magnitudes. Comprehensive performance analysis using MAE, MSE, and RMSE shows EMA's superior accuracy. Implemented in Jupyter Notebook with Python libraries.
