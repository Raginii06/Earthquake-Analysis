This project optimises earthquake data analysis by utilising Redis Cache for efficient storage and
retrieval. It imports data from reliable sources like the USGS, employing key-value pairs or
sorted sets for flexible querying based on criteria such as magnitude, date, or location. Statistical
calculations and visualisations offer insights into seismic patterns. The caching mechanism in
Redis improves performance by storing frequently accessed results.
